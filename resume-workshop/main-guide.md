# Resumes and Portfolios for Engineers

This document gives you some guidelines and offers you resources that may or may not be useful when drafting your resume and crafting your portfolio. Remember that there is not a *correct* way to do this, and I (John Sullivan) do not necessarily know what I'm talking about.

## Resumes

### Some Examples

It is often easiest to learn by example and see what others have done so that you can either emulate them, or decide you don't like the route they went. Here are some resumes I've collected. You can make your own judgements as to each of their merits.

Each of these resumes is from a UC Riverside student or alumni.

### The Trouble

Advice on how to write a resume can be found all over the internet. Tons of people have a strong opinion on the subject, and much of it is conflicting. The issue is that a resume is a marketing tool and you don't know your target audience.

For example, some websites claim that one particular group of people will be looking at your resume (recruiters, developers, managers, founders, etc.) but the reality is not so simple. You won't necessarily know what type of person is going to look at your resume when you send it to a company, and even if you do, you probably don't want to create a resume tailored for each company.

So what do you do? Who knows. My advice would be to try your best to make a resume that's attractive to the greatest number of people, and form your own opinions about how to do that.
