# Resumes and Portfolios for Engineers

This document gives you some guidelines and offers you resources that may or may not be useful when drafting your resume and crafting your portfolio. Remember that there is not a *correct* way to do this, and I (John Sullivan) do not necessarily know what I'm talking about.

## Resumes

### Goal

A resume's primary job is to convince the reader that you are worth interviewing.

### Some Examples

It is often easiest to learn by example and see what others have done so that you can either emulate them, or decide you don't like the route they went. Here are some resumes I've collected. You can make your own judgments as to each of their merits.

Each of these is from a UC Riverside student or alumni.

### Questionable Advice

Advice on how to write a resume can be found all over the internet. Tons of people have a strong opinion on the subject, and much of it is conflicting. A reason for this confliction is that a resume is a marketing tool and neither you nor the person giving advice knows your target audience.

For example, some websites claim that one particular group of people will be looking at your resume (recruiters, developers, managers, founders, etc.) but the reality is not so simple. You won't necessarily know what type of person is going to look at your resume when you send it to a company, and even if you do, you probably don't feel like creating a resume tailored for each company.

So what do you do? Who knows. My advice would be to try your best to make a resume that's attractive to the greatest number of people, and form your own opinions about how to do that.

### What Tool?

Many people suggest using one tool to create your portfolio over another. I'd say it doesn't matter at all and you shouldn't stress about it, as long as you can generate a PDF at the end of the day. As a special mention though, if you're not comfortable with Latex you should probably not use it.

### Actual Advice

*Remember what I just said about being careful about what advice you take. What I say here is not necessarily right so make your own judgements.*

#### Plain Text

Some companies only accept plain text resumes (Google, Khan Academy, and Mozilla to name a few) so you'll want to prepare both a nice looking plaintext version of your resume along with a better formatted PDF version. I recommend writing the plaintext version using Markdown style. You can see my own plain text resume [here](https://gist.github.com/brownhead/7033134) for an example.

#### Design

You will be judged on the design of your resume, whether it's subconscious or not. My guess is that the move towards plain text resumes is an attempt to get away from this (who really cares if a systems engineer can make a nicely formatted document anyways), but there are still many companies that will ask for you resume in PDF format. Therefore, you should try to make your resume as readable as possible. This is not straightforward and will take lots of iteration.

#### Don't Add Useless Text

If something in your resume will not do a good job at convincing someone that you're worth interviewing, it shouldn't be there. Everything you write in your resume should be useful and interesting information.

*My own opinion* regarding some common things in resumes that I don't think are worthwhile to include are...

 * **Objective**: All the resumes for a particular position have basically the same objective. If your objective is something that's not entirely obvious (ex: "I want to find an internship that will let me ride swivel chairs down hallways") it might be worthwhile, otherwise, probably not.
 * **References Available on Request**: If the company wants references they'll tell you so. They will also assume you have references more than likely, so this isn't adding any useful information.
 * **Anything Potentially Legally-Grey**: Don't include a picture, your marital status, your age, your race, or anything else that might put the person looking at your resume in an awkward position legally.

#### List Projects

If you don't have a lot of relevant work experience, you should think about including some projects you've worked on (make sure to appropriately label them as projects though). Did you make an awesome game in High School? Put it in. This information may be duplicated in your portfolio, but it may make the difference between a reviewer checking out your portfolio or sending you a "thanks but no thanks" email.

#### Don't Lie

You will probably be found out during the interview process. Make sure not to embellish either. Just make selectively choose the facts about you that show you in the best light (ex: did you do a contract in high school but end up disappearing before finishing it? probably best not to include it in your resume).

## Portfolios

### Goal

A portfolio's primary job is to provide evidence of your competancy and passion. This will lead to a higher chance of getting an interview, and higher chance of your interviews themselves going well.

### Do I need one?

No. I think anyone would say that you're better off with one though, and **I** would say that you are **extremely** better off with one. This is because so few developers have a proper portfolio that simply having one will put you far ahead of other applicants.

### Examples

Here are examples of portfolios from UCR Students and Alumni.

### Content

Your portfolio should consist of at least some projects that look cool and show off your passion and skills. You can also add articles or blog posts, biographies, additional information that would go on your resume if there was room, or anything else you'd like your reviewer to see.

Any code related to your project should be hosted on a public repository that is easy to navigate. I highly recommend [GitHub](https://github.com) myself, though I hear lots of good things about [BitBucket](https://bitbucket.org/) as well. I would **not** recommend using Google Code or SourceForge as they are generally not nearly as friendly for a casual observer and have a bad stigma in many programming communities.

### Marketing

The first page that a reviewer hits on your portfolio may only last 10 seconds or so. You want to make sure that in that time your landing page causes the reviewer to make the decision that you are worth interviewing. Anything on your portfolio's landing page that takes away from that should not be there.

If you already have the interview, your interviewer will almost certainly check out the projects in your portfolio in a more depth (one interviewer even went through the code base of one of my projects and started quizzing me on my implementation). Therefore, you want to have some solid content. If you can plant a seed in the interviewer's head that you are worth hiring, before the interview even starts, you will have a much easier time.

### How to make one?

Making a portfolio can be a lot of work. If you don't already know how to create websites using HTML and CSS, you'll have a tough time making something that is pleasant to navigate. Therefore, if you are not confident you can make a good site, I recommend [finding a template you can use](http://themeforest.net/category/site-templates). You probably won't find a good free template, but paid website templates can be very cheap so look around for something you can afford.

After you'd brought up your website, you should host it on [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) and buy a domain name from a registrar like [name.com](http://name.com) (I would stay away from GoDaddy for reasons of bad support and bad history). Several members of ACM can help you with this step.

Remember not to devote too much time to design before you have an excellent idea what your content will consist of though. For example, if most of your projects don't have a GUI then you won't be able to make a gallery of screenshots.

## Additional Resources

### Getting Design Critiques

Once you finish your portfolio and/or resume you should post your work to the [subreddit /r/design_critiques](http://www.reddit.com/r/design_critiques) to hear what people think of it.

### Get into the Reviewers Head

People who review resumes and interview developers often take advice from others who do the same. You should search the internet for articles that give such advice. Remember that different people have different takes on how to hire developers though, so naturally there will be a lot of conflicting information.

Below is a growing list of such articles.
